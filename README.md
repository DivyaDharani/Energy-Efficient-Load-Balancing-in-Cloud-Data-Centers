# Energy Efficient Load Balancing in Cloud Data Centers using Clustering Technique 

Applied **Cloud Computing** and **Machine Learning** Techniques 

* Implemented an efficient load balancing model for servers in data centers with K-means Clustering algorithm, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, using JADE (Java Agent Development) framework
* Achieved maximized resource utilization, minimized energy consumption, fewer migrations, and efficient server consolidation

**Abstract:**

Cloud computing has seen tremendous growth in recent days. As a result of this, there has been a great increase in the growth of data centers all over the world. These data centers consume a lot of energy, resulting in high operating costs. The imbalance in load distribution among the servers in the data center results in increased energy consumption. Server consolidation can be handled by migrating all virtual machines in those underutilized servers. Migration causes performance degradation of the job, based on the migration time and number of migrations. Considering these aspects, the proposed clustering agent-based model improves energy saving by efficient allocation of the VMs to the hosting servers, which reduces the response time for initial allocation. Middle VM migration (MVM) strategy for server consolidation minimizes the number of VM migrations. Further, randomization of extra resource requirement done to cater to real-time scenarios needs more resource requirements than the initial requirement. Simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the number of migrations and response time for user request and improves energy saving in the cloud environment.
