done in CA 
	=>index out of bound exception in FrontEndAgent.java => VirtualMachine selectedvm = vmcluster2.get(min);(116)
	=>search in other clusters if the cluster chosen has no sufficient VMs satisfying the given request

=>display job execution logs in different colors(one color for server, another for vm and so on)

done => Fix bug in 'NullPointerException' in selected_server and selected_vm variables
done => Do necessary actions for 'No potential server found' case


done => Server selection for migration when server's threshold is exceeded

=> 'Server machine received to ...' message is the last one to appear - do necessary actions for this case
=> remove the dummy variable in VMA.java
=> remove unnecessary print messages


=>while monitoring threshold continuously, make sure it doesn't exceed the activation count repeatedly just because we are monitoring continuously

done =>Remove outer loop in Migration class in VMA (since the CA returns the correct cluster which has the necessary VM)
done =>Check cluster emptiness in VMA in Migration part

Server Consolidation
	done => Monitoring status of servers in FA
	done => Leader selection in FA
	Migration
	Turning off servers
	
ERRORS to be rectified:
=> ERROR IDENTIFIED => INNER LOOP IN VMA.JAVA IS NOT RUNNING UP TO n.
=> Migration is triggered for the same server many times for the same VM
