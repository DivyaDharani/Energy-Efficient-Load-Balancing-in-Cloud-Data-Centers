done -> execution completed message should not come for vm which needs migration (merge two timers)

done -> include request no. in vm execution completion messages

done - problem in VMA - clustering request sent;but no reply

done - after migration , make the VM (from which the job is taken) FREE -> status = VirtualMachine.FREE 

=>index out of bound exception in FrontEndAgent.java => VirtualMachine selectedvm = vmcluster2.get(min);(116)

=>search in other clusters if the cluster chosen has no sufficient VMs satisfying the given request

=>display job execution logs in different colors(one color for server, another for vm and so on)

done - find some ways to access server's parameters like load percentage through VM available in VMCluster
done - In SMA - Respond to ACLMessage by sending server machine instance to VMA

done - Server selection for migration when VM's capacity is not sufficient for the job
done - migration for load balancing (in the above case)

=> Fix bug in 'NullPointerException' in selected_server and selected_vm variables
=> Do necessary actions for 'No potential server found' case
=> 'Server machine received to ...' message is the last one to appear - do necessary actions for this case
=> remove the dummy variable in VMA.java


=> Server selection for migration when server's threshold is exceeded

=>while monitoring threshold continuously, make sure it doesn't exceed the activation count repeatedly just because we are monitoring continuously
